# PHP Design Patterns
Examples of different design patterns written in PHP.

(this is a work in progress)

The code is meant to explain the pattern, not to be the best solution to the "problem".
In every sub folder is a Client.php, you can execute this on the CLI to see the code in action.

## Real world examples
####Observer
* Symfony's Events system (http://symfony.com/doc/current/event_dispatcher.html)

####Singleton
* The CodeIgniter framework relies heavily on this pattern (https://codeigniter.com/)

### Sources
The examples described here are based on the book "Head First Design Patterns" by Eric and Elisabeth Freeman.
